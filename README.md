# MandelbrotMenge
This is the exercise of the Distributed Systems course in the fifth semester of my bachelor in computer science degree.

## Task 1
Create an application which can display the mandelbrot set.

## Task 2
Create a server which calculates the mandelbrot set instead of the application (of task 1) itself.
Because we had to do this as a team, we had to agree upon a uniformly communication protocol.
